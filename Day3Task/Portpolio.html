            “The question how knowledge should be defined is perhaps the most 
            important and difficult of the three with which we shall deal. This may seem surprising:
            at first sight it might be thought that knowledge might be defined as belief which is in agreement with the facts."
        </p>
        <p>
            "The trouble is that no one knows what a belief is, no one knows what a fact is, 
            and no one knows what sort of agreement between them would make a belief true. Let us begin with belief.”
